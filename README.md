# 🧪 Advanced Periodic Table 🔬

A Python-based interactive periodic table application that allows users to search for elements by **symbol**, **atomic number**, or **element name** and get comprehensive details including **atomic weight**, **category**, **discovery year**, and more. To enhance user experience, a **voice feedback system** has been integrated.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search by element **symbol**, **name**, or **atomic number**
- 📢 **Voice-based output** for auditory interaction
- 📚 Rich information for each element (e.g., atomic mass, group, period, category, etc.)
- 🧠 Educational tool for students and chemistry enthusiasts
- 🐍 Written completely in **Python** using standard libraries

## 🧠 How It Works

The project uses a custom-built module that contains data for all chemical elements. The main program imports this module and allows the user to:

1. Input the element’s **symbol**, **name**, or **atomic number**
2. Retrieve all associated information
3. Listen to the information via **text-to-speech**
